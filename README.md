# MewbileTech-Phone-Company
- Building software to keep track of their historic customer data.
- Built a program to read in a dataset of customer calls, set geographically in Toronto, and produce a visualization of this past calling activity on a real map of the city
-  Able to filter results, (for example, displaying only calls and texts from a particular customer)
-  display a detailed bill that a given customer would have been sent during a specific month(using the term “to filter” to indicate that we want to display only those calls which match the search criterion)
